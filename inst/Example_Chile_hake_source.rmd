# Introduction
This is an example OM documentation file. It is based on a recent case study of Chile common hake from a
recent DLMtool workshop in Valparaiso, Chile, organized by Oceana Chile and funded by a joint project between 
Oceana, WWF, and EDF.

# Stock Parameters


## maxage
The only reason not to make this very large for all stocks (e.g. maxage = 100) is that the more ages, the greater the
number of calculations and the slower the MSE will run. Let's consider a rule of thumb: if the annual survival 
rate S to age a is calculated as $S_a = e^{-M_a}$, then the age corresponding with a 1% survival rate would be: 
maxage = $-ln(0.01)/M$. 

Based on this reasoning, the value for maxage was set based on the lower bound of the estimated range for M (see below). 


## R0
This is the level of unfished recruitment. Unless management options are specified in absolute
numbers (e.g. tonnes) the MSE is scale-less (has no units) and this value simply doesn't matter

## M
The instantaneous annual natural mortality rate in the recent stock assessment was assumed to be 0.33 (Tascheri et al., 2017). In this example, we arbitrarily bracket the base case value by +/- 20% which leads to range in mean M of 0.26 ? 0.40. The bracketing is intended to represent the uncertainty in M that is typical in most fishery settings. 

Even extensive mark-recapture analyses rarely produce M estimates with a CV (standard deviation / mean) of less than 10%. The +/- 20% bracketing of 0.33 is roughly equivalent to the 5%-95% probability interval of a probability distribution for M with mean 0.33 and 10% CV.

## M2


## Mexp
Natural mortality was assumed to be constant for all age/size-classes.

## Msd
Given that M is very poorly quantified in most fishery settings, the annual variability in M is essentially unknown. All that can be concluded is that M should vary among years. To address
this possibility in our simulations we specify inter-annual variability in M of up to 10%.

## Mgrad
Persistent underlying trends in natural mortality have been hypothesized in response to, for example, shifts in trophic dynamics (e.g., predation) and regime shifts. The current
assessment document for common hake hypotheses an increasing trend for M due to jumbo squid (Tascheri et al., 2017). Therefore, for the purposes of this simulation, M was simulated as a time-varying parameter with a consistent increase in M between 0 and 0.25% per year.

## h
The steepness of the stock-recruitment curve is the level of unfished recruitment at 20% of unfished spawning biomass. It follows it ranges between 0.2 (linear relationship of recruitment with SSB) and 1 (average recruitment is constant and unrelated to SSB) for the Beverton and Holt stock-recruitment model. For this analysis, we specify a range of 0.50 ? 0.70 for the steepness parameter. The current assessment model doesn't estimate this parameter and assumes a value h=0.67 (Tascheri et al., 2017).

## SRrel
 This parameter specifies the model for the mean stock-recruitment relationship. DLMtool SRrel values can be 1 (Beverton Holt) or 2 (Ricker). We follow the assessment and assume a Ricker stock-recruitment relationship (2).

## Perr
 The magnitude of annual recruitment deviations was based on the stock assessment document (Tascheri et al., 2017).

## AC
 The current assessment doesn't report estimates for autocorrelation in recruitment, but the model results showed a strong autocorrelation in the residuals (see Fig 47 in Stock Assessment). 

## recgrad


## Period

## Amplitude


## Linf
Estimates of growth were taken from Aguayo and Ojeda (1987), and Tascheri et al. (2017).

## K
Estimates of growth were taken from Aguayo and Ojeda (1987), and Tascheri et al. (2017).

## t0
Estimates of growth were taken from Aguayo and Ojeda (1987), and Tascheri et al. (2017).

## LenCV
There is little information available on the variability of length-at-age for this species. We based the parameter range for this slot on values typically observed in teleosts.

## Ksd
This is some information available for this parameter across years (Cerna et al., 2013), but it is difficult to determine a long-term trend. We assume a small amount of inter-annual variability in this parameter.

## Kgrad
We assume virtually no long-term trend in this parameter.

## Linfsd
This is some information available for this parameter across years (Cerna et al., 2013), but it is difficult to determine a long-term trend. We assume a small amount of inter-annual variability in this parameter.

## Linfgrad
We assume virtually no long-term trend in this parameter.

## L50
The range for this parameter was based on the results of Alarcon and Arancibia (1993).

There appears to be a shift in maturity-at-length over time (Tascheri et al., 2017). Currently, maturity-at-length is assumed to be time-invariant in DLMtool. If this is an important aspect to consider, we can modify the DLMtool model to account for time-varying maturity-at-length.

## L50_95
 Based on the same studies as used above.

## D
We set the bounds for this parameter based on the results of the recent stock assessment, which estimated depletion as 0.21 (Tascheri et al., 2017). The wider bounds were used to reflect the uncertainty estimate of stock depletion in the stock assessment.


## a
 Based on the empirical length-weight relationship (Cerna & Oyarzun 1998).

## b
 Based on the empirical length-weight relationship (Cerna & Oyarzun 1998).

## Frac_area_1
We simulate a fully fixed stock and assume half the stock is in area 1 and half in area 2.

## Prob_staying
We simulate a well mixed stock and assume half individuals remain in the same area among years.

## Fdisc
There was little information available on the discard mortality for this species. The range for this parameter was set based on expert knowledge of the fishery and the stock.

## Source
The OM was based on the hard work of Instituto de Fomento Pesquero scientists.



# Fleet Parameters

## Name


## nyears
The stock assessment and fishery data indicates that the fishery has been operating
since 1940, with the latest assessment (from which the parameters in this OM are based) in 2016.

## Spat_targ
This feature is currently being developed for DLMtool. We're going to stick to the default level of 1 (targeting in proportion to density) in preparation for its implementation.

## EffYears
 This is the vertex (year) for a major change in effort (fishing mortality rate). In this case
we use the estimates from the SSRA for each historical year and therefore we make this 1, 2, 3, ? 77 (nyears).


## EffLower
We use the SSRA analysis to estimate the lower bound for the historical fishing effort
for each year. The details of the analysis should be included here, but we are lazy and have skipped this step (this is only an example!)

## EffUpper
As above.


## Esd
This is really variability in addition to the underlying trend described by EffLower and EffUpper. It is used only to generate historical fishing patterns. In data-limited cases a very simple (general, mean) historical trajectory in effort may be established and it may be desirable to add additional inter-annual variability to reflect changes in fishing intensity among years. In this case we're going to be using stock assessment outputs directly that have detailed annual variability information and have no need to superimpose greater variability. 

## qinc
In this example, we allow for an increasing future trends in fishing efficiency by setting up to a 2% annual increase in fishing efficiency.

## qcv
To evaluate variability in fishing efficiency among years it is necessary to compare observed catch rates with an index of abundance (or assessed biomass). For this parameter we assume that the fleet with varies in its efficiency between years.


## L5
We assume that the length corresponding to 5% vulnerability to the fishing gear is in the range of 15 ? 20 cm. Queirolo et al. (2012) demonstrate that mesh size is an import factor in determining the size at first capture.

## LFS
We assume that the length of full selectivity is in the range of 35 ? 40 cm (Queirolo et al., 2012).

## Vmaxlen
We assume that there is no dome-shaped selectivity because empirical studies have
modeled the selectivity as asymptotic (Galvez & Hernan, 2005; Queirolo et al., 2008, 2012) for this hake fishery. Thus, all lengths above LFS are fully vulnerable to the fishery. 

## isRel
Selectivity parameters are in absolute numbers (not relative to size of maturity).


## LR5
Based on empirical selectivity studies (Queirolo et al. 2012) and the mean length-at-age
curve described by the von Bertalanffy growth model, we set the range for the length at  5% retention to 20 ? 25 cm. Note that the legal mesh size is 100 mm and according to Queirolo et al. (2012), the 50% retention length is 30.8 cm of total length.

## LFR
Based on Queirolo et al. (2012) and the mean length-at-age curve described by the von
Bertalanffy growth model, we set the range for the length at full retention to 40 ? 50 cm.

## Rmaxlen
 We understand that fishers value large size individuals and assume that the retention
curve is asymptotic by setting this parameter to 1.

## DR
The general discard rate. What fraction of fish across all size and age classes are discarded? There is general discarding across all size-classes in some fisheries. We assume that this is not the case in the hake fishery.



## SelYears
These slots weren't used so we can leave the text blank.

## AbsSelYears


## L5Lower


## L5Upper

## LFSLower


## LFSUpper


## VmaxLower


## VmaxUpper


## CurrentYr
The current year (last historical year) can be used to make the plots more
informative. As the stock assessment which was used to parameterize the OM uses data up to 2016, we set this parameter to 2016.



# Obs Parameters

## Name


## Cobs
Here was assume that the annual catches a reported somewhat imprecisely.

## Cbiascv
We assume that it is likely that the reported catches are sometimes biased (that is,
higher or lower than the real catches) and set the CV for this parameter to 0.1. This
corresponds to the assumption that 95% of reported catches are between 80% and 120% of the real catches.

## CAA_nsamp
The number of samples taken per year for age and length compositions. We assume these are around 5,000 to 10,000 and 250 to 500 fish per year for the length and age compositions based on Lillo et al., (2017).

## CAA_ESS
See above.

## CAL_nsamp
Here we assume that there is some non-independence in the observations
of age and length (ie individuals are caught in age/size monospecific aggregations. The effective sample size is hence assumed to be lower than the sample size at around 100 independent observations, 50 - 150.

## CAL_ESS
See above.

## CALcv
Assumed that catch-at-length has no obseration error. 

## Iobs
Chile hake has a survey that can act as both an index of relative abundance (I) and an
index of absolute abundance (Bt) (Lillo et al., 2017). Here we set the allow for the fishery independent survey to have some observation error.

## Icv
This parameter is not used in this version of DLMtool.

## Btcv
See Iobs

## Btbias
The bias in the absolute abundance index is assumed to be low and 95% of simulated
data sets are assumed to be within 20% of the true value.

## beta
Since the survey is carried out according to a systematic homogenous design (Lillo et al.,
2017) we assume that it varies in proportion to real abundance changes (beta values less than 1 are hyperstable ? index declining slower than real abundance, beta greater than 1 are hyperdeplete ? index declining faster than real abundance).

## LenMcv
Some MPs use length at maturity as a reference point for setting size limits. Here we assume we could get this consistently wrong by around +/- 10%.

## Mcv
We assume of a CV of 0.2 to reflect some uncertainty in this parameter.

## Kcv
 We assume of a CV of 0.1 to reflect some uncertainty in this parameter.

## t0cv
We choose not to simulate bias in this growth parameter and assume in all cases it is correct.

## Linfcv
We assume of a CV of 0.1 to reflect some uncertainty in this parameter.

## LFCcv
 Given the reasonably extensive length sampling data, it is straightforward to estimate LFC for hake from the length frequency data and this is likely to be reasonably well known without substantial bias. 

## LFScv
Estimating LFS is more difficult than estimating LFC because the length frequency data are the product of both increasing vulnerability and the declining age-structure of the population given M and F. 

## FMSYcv
Note that FMSY is not the same thing as the maximum sustainable rate of fishing, Fmax.
 
Assuming surplus production dynamics, FMSY is half of Fmax. Above FMSY and below Fmax are sustainable fishing rates that lead to lower biomass than BMSY and do not provide as much yield (on average, at equilibrium) as fishing at FMSY with biomass at BMSY It has been proposed by Gulland (1978) and Walters and Martell (2003) that FMSY may be summarized as a fraction of natural mortality rate M. Gulland suggested FMSY = M, Walters and Martell though FMSY=0.5 x M. 

It is not clear how biased such an estimate could be but assuming that this uncertainty reflects the possible range of prescribed values (and brackets the true ratio) and this occurs on top of bias in estimates of natural mortality, the range of possible biases must be higher than that assigned to M (0.33). This is set at 0.4 to reflect the potential for inaccurate estimates of FMSY.

## FMSY_Mcv
A number of MPs aim to fish at a fixed rate proportional to the estimate of M (e.g. Fratio). Other MPs use this ratio to undertake stock reduction analysis (e.g. DB-SRA). Given the references above we set this to be moderately inaccurate given a CV of 0.15.


## BMSY_B0cv
 We have assigned a relatively precise CV for potential accuracy at 0.05.

## Irefcv
Here we assume that the index and MSY (a desirable catch level) can be known more accurately than a desirable absolute biomass level (e.g. BMSY) and assign these a range
determined by a CV of 0.2.

## Crefcv
As Irefcv.

## Brefcv
Arbitrarily we make this twice as potentially biased as Iref and Cref.
 
## Dbiascv
These are probably the most controversial observation model quantities, after all the most valuable output of a data-rich assessment is arguably the level of stock depletion  (typically measured as spawning stock biomass today relative to unfished). If we could know this, for stocks with stationary productivity (where depletion is a very good predictor of stock productivity) we could achieve very good management performance with simple harvest control rules (in essence this is how the outputs of data-rich stock assessments are used). 

Having said this, in most cases assessments are evaluated based on their fit to a fishery dependent (e.g. catch per unit effort) or fishery independent (e.g. trawl survey, acoustic survey) relative abundance index. It follows that often the depletion estimate arising from a stock assessment follows the raw data fairly well. Consequently, even anecdotal historical catch rate data may be used in a data-limited context to frame estimates of stock depletion. Similarly, if unfished densities of a species can be quantified (e.g. urchins per sq km of habitat), total estimates of habitat and current density surveys could be used to extrapolate a range of stock depletion.


Alternatively, length frequency data can provide an imprecise estimate of stock  epletion when accompanied with estimates of natural mortality rate and growth (and some  assumption about the pattern of recent fishing rates).

Here we assign an arbitrary value of 0.25 which is relatively imprecise and means that assume depletion could up to double or half of the true simulated value.

## Dcv
In a data-limited situation it is unlikely that radically new data would become available regarding depletion meaning that while estimates may be biased, they are likely to be relatively precise. We assign a level of imprecision consistent with observations of catch rate data among years at between 0.05- 0.1.

## hcv
The stock assessment provides very little support for particular values of recruitment
compensation. In DLMtool this is parameterized as steepness (the fraction of unfished
recruitment at 20% of unfished spawning biomass, a value ranging from 0.2-1). Here we assume that any MP could get this wrong by a large margin.

## Reccv
We do not have a good idea how good the recruitment index for hake is. Here we assume it could be moderately imprecise with a CV between 0.1 and 0.2.

## B0cv
Not used in this version of DLMtool.

## rcv
Not used in this version of DLMtool.

## Fcurbiascv
Not used in this version of DLMtool.

## Fcurcv
Not used in this version of DLMtool.

## maxagecv
