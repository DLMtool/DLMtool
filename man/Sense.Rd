\usage{
Sense(Data, MP, nsense = 6, reps = 100, perc = c(0.05, 0.5, 0.95), ploty = T)
}
\arguments{
\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{MP}{A character string representing an MP applied in calculating the TAC recommendations in the DLM object}

\item{nsense}{The number of points over which to calculate the TAC (resolution)}

\item{reps}{The number of samples of the quota taken for the calculation of the TAC}

\item{perc}{The percentile of the sample TAC}

\item{ploty}{A logical switch, (T/F, should a plot be drawn?)}
}
\description{
A function that determines the inputs for a given data-limited method of
class Output and then analyses the sensitivity of TAC estimates to 
marginal differences in each input. The range used for sensitivity is based 
on the user-specified CV for that input (e.g. CV_Mort, Mort)
