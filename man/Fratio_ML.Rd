\title{An FMSY/M ratio MP that uses a mean length estimator of recent Z}
\format{An object of class \code{DLM_output} of length 1.}
\usage{
Fratio_ML(x, DLM_data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{DLM_data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of TAC samples}
}
\description{
Calculates the OFL based on a fixed ratio of FMSY/M and an estimate of
current stock size from a mean-length estimator.
}
\note{
The mean length extension was programmed by Gary Nelson as part of his
excellent R package 'fishmethods'
