\usage{
Converge(MSEobj, thresh = 2, Plot = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSEobj}{An MSE object of class \code{'MSE'}}

\item{thresh}{The convergence threshold (percentage). If mean performance
metrics are within thresh percent of the second to last interation, the MSE
can be considered to have converged.}

\item{Plot}{Should figures be plotted?}

\description{
Have I undertaken enough simulations (nsim)? Has my MSE converged on stable
(reliable) peformance metrics?
