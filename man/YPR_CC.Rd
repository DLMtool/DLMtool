\title{Yield Per Recruit analysis to get FMSY proxy F01 paired to a naive catch
curve estimate of recent Z}
\usage{
YPR_CC(x, Data, reps = 100, Fmin=0.005)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object (class DLM)}

\item{reps}{The number of samples of the TAC}

\item{Fmin}{The minimum fishing mortality rate inferred from the catch-curve
analysis}
}
\description{
A simple yield per recruit approximation to FMSY (F01) which is the position
of the ascending YPR curve for which dYPR/dF = 0.1(dYPR/d0) A naive
catch-curve analysis is used to determine recent Z which given M (Mort)
gives F and thus abundance = Ct/(1-exp(-F))
