\description{
A function to read in operating model parameters from an Excel spreadsheet
with tabs named following specific convention. Since DLMtool 4.5 this function is no
longer recommended. Use 'OMinit' instead.
}
\details{
The Excel spreadsheet must have tabs named with the following convention.
For example if \code{stkname} is 'myFish', the Stock parameters are in a tab
named 'myFishStock', Fleet parameters in a tab named 'myFishFleet', 
Observation parameters in a tab named 'myFishObs', and Implementation in 'myFishImp'. 
All tabs (Stock, Fleet, Obs, and Imp) must be present for a single stock. You can have multiple
stocks in a single spreadsheet, provided that the stock names are different.
