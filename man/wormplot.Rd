\title{Biomass wormplot}
\usage{
wormplot(MSEobj, Bref = 0.5, LB = 0.25, UB = 0.75)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSEobj}{Object of class MSE, output of the runMSE function}

\item{Bref}{The reference fraction of BMSY (to evaluate the probability of
exceeding this level)}

\item{LB}{The lower bound probability that seperates red (bad) and yellow
(O.K.) colored segments}

\item{UB}{The upper bound probability that seperates yellow (O.K.) and green
(good) colored segments}
}
\description{
A worm plot for plotting the likelihood of meeting biomass targets in future
years.
}
\details{
Returns a matrix of nMPs rows and proyears columns which is the fraction of
simulations for which biomass was above Bref.
