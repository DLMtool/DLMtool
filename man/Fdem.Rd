\title{Demographic FMSY method}
\usage{
Fdem(x, Data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of TAC samples}
}
\description{
FMSY is calculated as r/2 where r is calculated from a demographic approach
(inc steepness). Coupled with an estimate of current abundance that gives
you the OFL.
}
\details{
Made up for this package. This uses Murdoch McAllister's demographic r
method to derive FMSY (r/2) and then makes the quota r*current biomass / 2.
Easy.
