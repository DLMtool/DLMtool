\title{An FMSY/M ratio method paired with the 40-10 rule}
\usage{
Fratio4010(x, Data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of TAC samples}
}
\description{
Calculates the OFL based on a fixed ratio of FMSY to M multiplied by a
current estimate of abundance. In this method DBSRA is paired with the 40-10
rule that throttles back the OFL to zero at 10 percent of unfished biomass.
