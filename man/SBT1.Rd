\title{SBT simple MP}
\usage{
SBT1(x, Data, reps = 100, yrsmth=10, k1=1.5, k2=3, gamma=1)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of samples of the TAC}

\item{yrsmth}{The number of years for evaluating trend in relative abundance
indices}

\item{k1}{Control parameter}

\item{k2}{Control parameter}

\item{gamma}{Control parameter}
}
\description{
An MP that makes incremental adjustments to TAC recommendations based on the
apparent trend in CPUE
}
\details{
This isn't exactly the same as the proposed methods and is stochastic in
this implementation. The method doesn't tend to work too well under many
circumstances possibly due to the lack of 'tuning' that occurs in the real
SBT assessment environment. You could try asking Rich Hillary at CSIRO about
this approach.
