\description{
The MP adjusts catch based on the value of the index in the current year relative to the 
time series mean and standard error.
 
The mean and standard error of the index time series is calculated. There are two thresholds 
which delineates whether catch is reduced, held constant, or increased. The catch is reduced by 0.75
if the Z-score of the current year's index is less than -0.44. The catch is increased by 1.05
if the Z-score of the current year's index is greater than 1.96. Otherwise, the catch is held constant.
