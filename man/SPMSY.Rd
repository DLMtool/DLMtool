\title{Catch trend Surplus Production MSY MP}
\usage{
SPMSY(x, Data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of samples of the TAC}
}
\description{
An MP that uses Martell and Froese (2012) method for estimating MSY to
determine the OFL. Since their approach estimates stock trajectories based
on catches and a rule for intrinsic rate of increase it also returns
depletion. Given their surplus production model predicts K, r and depletion
it is straighforward to calculate the OFL based on the Schaefer productivity
curve. OFL = dep x (1-dep) x r x K x 2
}
\details{
Requires the assumption that catch is proportional to abundance.
Occasionally the rule that limits r and K ranges does not allow r-K pairs to
be found that lead to the depletion inferred by the catch trajectories. In
this case this method widens the search.
