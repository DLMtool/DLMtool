\usage{
VOIplot(MSEobj, MPs = NA, nvars = 5, nMP = 4, Par = c("Obs", "OM"),
  YVar = c("Y", "B"), doPlot = TRUE, incStat = FALSE, availMP = NULL,
  acceptMP = NULL, incNames = TRUE, labcex = 0.8, quants = c(0.05,
  0.95))
}
\arguments{
\item{MSEobj}{An object of class MSE}

\item{MPs}{The MPs to plot. If NA it will plot the first nMP from MSEobj}

\item{nvars}{The number of observation or operating model parameters to plot
(number of columns)}

\item{nMP}{The maximum number of MPs to plot (number of rows)}

\item{Par}{Plot Operating Model (OM) or Observation (Obs) parameters?}

\item{YVar}{Variable for Y-Axis: Yield (Y) or Biomass (B) (relative to BMSY)}

\item{doPlot}{Output the plot?}

\item{incStat}{Include a print out of statistic describing the curviness of
the line?}

\item{availMP}{Optional character string of MPs that are available. These
names are colored black}

\item{acceptMP}{Optional character string of MPs that are acceptable. These
names are colored green if they are also in availMP}

\item{incNames}{Include the names?}

\item{labcex}{Character size of the label}

\item{quants}{Quantiles to calculate}
}
\value{
A list of all the information included in the plot
}
\description{
A function that relates parameters of the observation model and the
operating model parameters to yield.
