\title{Slope in surplus production MP}
\usage{
SPslope(x, Data, reps = 100, yrsmth = 4, alp = c(0.9, 1.1), bet = c(1.5,
  0.9))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of quota samples}

\item{yrsmth}{Years over which to smooth recent estimates of surplus
production}

\item{alp}{Condition for modifying the Data (bounds on change in
abundance)}

\item{bet}{Limits for how much the Data can change among years}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of Data recommendations
}
\description{
A management procedure that makes incremental adjustments to TAC
recommendations based on the apparent trend in recent surplus production.
Based on the theory of Mark Maunder (IATTC)
}
\details{
Note that this isn't exactly what Mark has previously suggested and is
stochastic in this implementation.
