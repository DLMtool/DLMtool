\title{A shorter version of the plot method for MSEs that just shows the overall
trade-offs}
\usage{
Tplot2(MSEobj, nam = NA)
}
\arguments{
\item{MSEobj}{An object of class 'MSE'}

\item{nam}{Name of the plot}
}
\description{
A trade-off plot for an MSE object that compares long-term yield (LTY:
fraction of simulations getting over half FMSY yield in the last ten years
of the projection), short-term yield (STY: fraction of simulations getting
over half FMSY yield in the first ten years of the projection), variability
in yield (VY: fraction of simulations where average annual variability in
yield is less than 10 per cent) and biomass level (B10: the fraction of
simulations in which biomass stays above 10 percent of BMSY).
