\title{A management procedure that incrementally adjusts the Effort according to
the mean length of recent catches.}
\usage{
LstepCE2(x, Data, reps = 100, yrsmth = 5, xx = 0, stepsz = 0.1,
llim = c(0.96, 0.98, 1.05))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of samples}

\item{yrsmth}{Years over which to smooth recent estimates of surplus
production}

\item{xx}{Parameter controlling the fraction of mean catch to start using in
first year}

\item{stepsz}{Parameter controlling the size of the effort update increment.}

\item{llim}{A vector of length reference points that determine the
conditions for increasing, maintaining or reducing the effort.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of input controls
}
\description{
A effort-based version of one of the four adaptive length-based MPs proposed
by Geromont and Butterworth 2014.
