\title{Demographic FMSY method using catch-curve analysis to estimate recent Z}
\usage{
Fdem_CC(x, Data, reps = 100, Fmin=0.005)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of TAC samples}

\item{Fmin}{The minimum fishing mortality rate derived from the catch-curve
analysis}
}
\description{
FMSY is calculated as r/2 from a demographic r prior method, current
abudnance is estimated from naive catch curve analysis.
