\title{Simulates catch at age and catch history data for testing SRA methods}
\usage{
SRAsim(OM, qmult = 0.5, CAApatchy = 0.4, Cpatchy = 1, Ipatchy = 0.4,
  MLpatchy = 0.4, nCAA = 100, nL = 200, sigmaE = 0.25, sigmaI = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{OM}{An operating model object with M, growth, stock-recruitment and maturity parameters specified.}

\item{qmult}{Fraction of natural mortality rate that is mean fishing mortality (Fishing catchability multiplier)}

\item{CAApatchy}{The fraction of years that have catch at age data}

\item{Cpatchy}{The fraction of years that have catch data}

\item{Ipatchy}{The fraction of years that have index data}

\item{MLpatchy}{The fraction of years that have mean length data}

\item{nCAA}{The number of independent annual catch at age observations (same among all years)}

\item{nL}{The number of independent annual catch at length observations (same among all years) for calculating mean length}

\item{sigmaE}{Level of simulated interannual variability in effort (F) expressed as a lognormal SD}

\item{sigmaI}{Observation error in relative abundance indices expressed as a lognormal SD}
}
\value{
A list: Chist = historical catch series,Recdevs = historical recruitment deviations (mean = 1), CAA = catch at age matrix, N = numbers at age matrix, SSB = annual spawning biomass, FM = Fishing mortality rate at age matrix, M = natural mortality rate \code{classy}
