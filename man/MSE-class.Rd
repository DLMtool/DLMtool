 \itemize{
 \item RefY: reference yield, the highest long-term yield (mean over last five years of projection) obtained from a fixed F strategy. This is a useful reference point for framing performance of MPs because it standardizes for starting point and future productivity. 
 \item M: instantaneous natural mortality rate
 \item Depletion: stock depletion (biomass / unfished biomass) in the final historical year (prior to projection)
 \item A: abundance (biomass) updated in each management update of projection
 \item BMSY_B0: most productive stock size relative to unfished
 \item FMSY_M: fishing mortality rate divided by natural mortality rate

 \item Msd: interannual variability in natural mortality rate (lognormal CV)
 \item procsd: process error - CV in log-normal recruitment deviations
 \item Esd: interannual variability in historical effort (fishing mortality rate)
 \item dFfinal: gradient in fishing mortality rate over final five years of the historical simulation
 \item MSY: Maximum Sustainable Yield

 \item Ksd: interannual variability in maximum growth rate (log normal CV)
 \item ageM: age at 50 per cent maturity
 \item LFS: length at full selection (the shortest length class where fishery selectivity is 100 per cent)
 \item age05: the age at 5 percent selectivity (ascending limb of selectivity curve)
 \item Vmaxage: the selectivity of the oldest age class (controls dome shape of selectivity curve)
 \item LFC: length at first capture, the smallest length that can be caught by the gear
 \item OFLreal: the true simulated Over Fishing Limit (FMSY x biomass) updated in each management update of the projection
 \item Spat_targ: spatial targetting parameter, fishing mortality rate across areas is proportional to vulnerable biomass raised to the power of this number. 
 \item Size_area_1: The size of area 1 relative to area 2
 \item Frac_area_1: the fraction of unfished biomass inhabiting area 1 (can be seen as fraction of habitat in area 1 or relative size of area 1)

 \item AC: autocorrelation in recruitment
