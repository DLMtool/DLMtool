TradePlot(MSEobj, XAxis = c("Overfishing", "Biomass:BMSY"),
  YAxis = c("Long-term Yield", "AnnualVar"), XThresh = c(30, 80),

}
\arguments{
\item{MSEobj}{Object of class MSE, output of the runMSE function}

\item{XAxis}{Character string describing the performance metrics for the
x-axis (or x-axes if vector; max 4). Must be chosen for list of existing PMs
and same length as YAxis. See \code{PMs}}

\item{YAxis}{Character string describing the performance metrics for the
y-axis (or y-axes if vector; max 4). Must be chosen for list of existing PMs
and same length as XAxis. See \code{PMs}}

\item{XThresh}{Minimum threshold values in percent (i.e., 50 = 50\%) for the
x-axes (must be same length as XAxis)}

\item{YThresh}{Minimum threshold values in percent (i.e., 50 = 50\%) for the
y-axes (must be same length as YAxis)}

\item{maxVar}{Reference for average annual variability in yield in percent}

\item{BmsyRef}{Reference level of BMSY, in proportion, i.e., 0.5 = 0.5BMSY}

\item{B0Ref}{Reference level of B0, in proportion, i.e., 0.2 = 0.2B0}

\item{AvailMPs}{vector of MPs that *could* be applied to the fishery, i.e.,
sufficient data exists. These a plotted with different symbol}

\item{ShowLabs}{Logical to specify if MP labels are shown}

\item{ShowCols}{Logical to specify if background colors are shown}
}
\description{
Creates a trade-off plot (up to four panels) of built-in performance
metrics.
}
\details{
Returns a list containing the names of performance metrics that meet the
minimum performance metrics for each trade-off, and ranks the MPs by
increasing distance from the top-right corner.
