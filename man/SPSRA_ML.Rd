\title{Surplus Production Stock Reduction Analysis using a mean-length estimate of
current stock depletion}
\usage{
SPSRA_ML(x, Data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object (class DLM)}

\item{reps}{The number of samples of the TAC taken}
}
\description{
A surplus production equivalent of DB-SRA that uses a demographically
derived prior for intrinsic rate of increase. A prior for depletion is
calculated from a mean-length estimator
}
\note{
The mean length extension was programmed by Gary Nelson as part of his
excellent R package 'fishmethods'
