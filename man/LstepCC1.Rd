\title{A management procedure that incrementally adjusts the TAC according to the
mean length of recent catches.}
\usage{
LstepCC1(x, Data, reps = 100, yrsmth = 5, xx=0, stepsz=0.05,
llim=c(0.96,0.98,1.05))
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of TAC samples}

\item{yrsmth}{Years over which to smooth recent estimates of surplus
production}

\item{xx}{Parameter controlling the fraction of mean catch to start using in
first year}

\item{stepsz}{Parameter controlling the size of the TAC update increment.}

\item{llim}{A vector of length reference points that determine the
conditions for increasing, maintaining or reducing the TAC.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of TAC recommendations
}
