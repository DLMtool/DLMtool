\title{Age-composition-based estimate of current stock depletion given constant Z
linked to an FMSY estimate to provide OFL (with a 40-10 rule)}
\usage{
CompSRA4010(x, Data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC.}
}
\description{
Estimates an OFL based on a Stock Reduction analysis fitted to current
age-composition data. Knife-edge vulnerability at age at maturity allows for
an FMSY estimate. OFL=FMSY*F/C
}
\note{
Given a fixed historical F, What level of depletion gives you this
length composition?
