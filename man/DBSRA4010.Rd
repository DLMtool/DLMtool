\title{Depletion-Based Stock Reduction Analysis paired with 40-10 harvest control
rule}
\usage{
DBSRA4010(x, Data, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of stochastic samples of the TAC recommendation}
}
\description{
User prescribed BMSY/B0, M, FMSY/M are used to find B0 and therefore the OFL
by back-constructing the stock to match a user specified level of stock
depletion (OFL = M * FMSY/M * depletion* B0). In this method DBSRA is paried
with the 40-10 rule that throttles back the OFL to zero at 10 percent of
unfished biomass.
