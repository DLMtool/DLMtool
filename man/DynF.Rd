\usage{
DynF(x, Data, yrsmth=10, gg=2, reps = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in a data-limited methods object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods object}

\item{yrsmth}{The number of historical recent years used for smoothing catch
and biomass data}

\item{gg}{A gain parameter that modifies F according to the gradient in
surplus production with biomass}

\item{reps}{The number samples of the TAC}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of TAC recommendations
}
\description{
The Fratio MP with a controller that changes the level of F according to the
relationship between Surplus production and biomass. Ie lower F when dSP/dB
is positive and higher F when dSP/dB is negative.
}
\details{
The method smoothes historical catches and biomass and then infers the
relationship between surplus production and biomass (as suggested by Mark
Maunder and Carl Walters). The approach then regulates a F based policy
according to this gradient in which F may range between two different
fractions of natural mortality rate.

The core advantage is the TAC(t) is not strongly determined by TAC(t-1) and
therefore errors are not as readily propagated. The result is method that
tends to perform alarmingly well and therefore requires debunking ASAP.
