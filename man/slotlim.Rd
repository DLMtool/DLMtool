\item{...}{Optional additional arguments that are ignored. Note arguments
\code{reps} or \code{...} are required for all input controls}

\description{
An example of the implementation of input controls in the DLM toolkit, where
selectivity-at-length is set using a slot limit; that is, a minimum and
maximum legal length.  The maximum limit is set here, quite arbitrarily, as
the 75th percentile between the new minimum legal length and the estimated
asymptotic length.
