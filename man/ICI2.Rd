\title{Less Precautionary Index Confidence Interval (ICI) MP by Jardim et al. (2015)}
\usage{
ICI2(x, Data, reps)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A position in data-limited methods data object}

\item{Data}{A data-limited methods data object}

\item{reps}{The number of TAC samples}
}
\description{
The MP adjusts catch based on the value of the index in the current year relative to the 
time series mean and standard error. This method is less precautionary of the two ICI MPs by allowing for a larger increase in TAC
and a lower threshold of the index to decrease the TAC (see Jardim et al. 2015).
}
\details{
The mean and standard error of the index time series is calculated. There are two thresholds 
which delineates whether catch is reduced, held constant, or increased. The catch is reduced by 0.75
if the Z-score of the current year's index is less than -1.96. The catch is increased by 1.25
if the Z-score of the current year's index is greater than 1.96. Otherwise, the catch is held constant.
