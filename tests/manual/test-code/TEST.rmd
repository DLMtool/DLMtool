## Completing the OM Documentation
This document is used to generate a HTML OM report document.

The document is separated into 7 sections:
1. Introduction (this section)
2. Custom Parameters (optional)
3. Stock Parameters
4. Fleet Parameters
5. Obs (Observation) Parameters
6. Imp (Implementation) Parameters
7. References

The Introduction section is used to briefly describe the fishery and the details of the Operating Model.
It should include an explanation for the OM parameters:
 * nsim: the number of simulations.
 * proyears: the number of projectio years.
 * interval: the management interval.
 * pstar: the percentile of the sample of the management recommendation for each method.
 * maxF: the maximum instantaneous fishing mortality rate that may be simulated for any given age class.
 * reps: the number of samples of the management recommendation for each method.

The Custom Parameters section is optional and should only be included if the cpars feature of DLMtool is used in the OM.
Delete both the heading and the text in this section if `cpars` are not used.

The Stock, Fleet, Obs, and Imp sections include each slot in these components of the OM object.
Provide details (including references where applicable) for the choice of values for each slot below the corresponding slot name (e.g., ## M).
For example: 
**M**
An explanation for the values of the natural mortality rate in the OM (Smith et al. 1999).

You do not need to include the actual values from the OM. These will be included automatically in the final compiled document.

References should be included in the 'References' section at the end of the document.

Once complete, this text file will be compiled into an OM Report Document.
This text file is linked to the Excel spreadsheet that was generated with the same file name.
It serves as a single documentation source for a DLMtool OM, and should be updated whenever parameter values in the OM spreadsheet are updated.

## Tips on filling this Document

This document is uses the Markdown format. All first and second level headings have been provided, and in general you
should only need to enter plain text.

You can have multiple paragraphs throughout the document.

The Introduction and Custom Parameters sections also support second and third level headings.

## An example Second level heading

### An example third level heading

### Technical Tip

This document will be compiled into Rmarkdown, and then a HTML document using Pandoc. Equations can be included by

using Latex (see [here](https://www.sharelatex.com/learn/Mathematical_expressions) for some examples).

## Replace all text below 'Introduction' new text.



# Custom Parameters
Optional. Only required if the `cpars` feature is used in the OM.

Provide details for the parameters included in 'cpars' here instead of in the corresponding slot sections below.
Text in the slot section below will be ignored if a parameter is included in 'cpars'.
Delete this section (including heading) if the `cpars` feature is not used in the OM.
